Unknowns-Lab-Sorting-Project
============================

Takes in two lists and sorts them in a pseudoranom/alternating fashion.

In this case the two lists represent two classes of bacteria: Gram Negative & Gram Positive.

The final list is to be used as a guide for numbered, unknown samples that students would receive.

The list keys are used by professors to identify if the student predicted the bacteria

by selective/differential laboratory methods. 

The purpose of the project was to save time at work as I used to do these combinatorics by hand.

What used to be an hourish project, is now done in just a function call.
